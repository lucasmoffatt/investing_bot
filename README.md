This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that provides investing advice tailored to Canadians.
It leverages OpenAI’s GPT models with embeddings, ChromaDB for vector storage, and a Gradio web interface for easy interaction.

The chatbot retrieves up-to-date financial knowledge from Canadian financial institutions and resources that you index into the database, ensuring answers are grounded in real, relevant content rather than relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge.
